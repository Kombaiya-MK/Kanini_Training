            Gundogan speaking to Sky Sports:

"The three points help but it is a completely different game, it is going to be a top game between the two top sides in England. 

"We are looking forward to it but we know how tough it is going to be."

            "We know Erling has scored a lot of goals but today he made the runs we need. He went into the areas where he can create space for others. 

"Hopefully he is not too injured because we need him."

        <div id="div3">
            "The team made a big effort and today was a game to show that we are in a good mood and in good shape.

"I think from the first minute we played a good game.

"Every game is a final for us."
